12. Demonoir
Here sound the steel pipes
Vibrations: Qliphotic frequencies
Aural chaos beckons

Tracts and tubes from the tunnels of set
Hang among veils

Abysmal winds stir the darkness
Carry the scent of boiling fat and burning flesh
Bonepyres glow behind the dimension drape

Sweeping scythe
Shivering chords
Bloodrain
Bloodfog
Bloodweb

Moon of madness - entangled
Sun of suffocation - hissing

In a sea of tar
Deathreign
Deathgloom
Death-hole
