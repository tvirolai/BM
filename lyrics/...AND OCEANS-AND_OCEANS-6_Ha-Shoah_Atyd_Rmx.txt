The fanfare chants, trumpets loud proclaim
Through all the world in the holy land's name
Obtain mutual forgiveness of each vice,
And crush the opened gates of paradise.

[chorus:]
Oh god, oh lord
Make the devil keep his word
Oh God of all
Now see the symbol fall

The mortal virtues in great fear
Formed the cross and nails and spear
Tainted dignity stands next in line
One soul alone, the disease of time

[chorus:]
Oh god, oh lord
Make the devil keep his word
Oh God of all
Now see the symbol fall

Now burn the flag of discipline
To raise the fists of libertine
For all moral virtues all begin
Cleanse the people blessed with sin
