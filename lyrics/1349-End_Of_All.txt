1. End Of All
I have haunted your soul
I have fought your battles
I gave you the answers
I took your pain away
 
Now is the time to harvest
Now is the time to collect
To see what you have conquered
And to send your soul: to hell!
 
Burning corpses, the stench of flesh
Scorched field, the cleansing of the earth
Where are your gods?
Your dying prayers as futile as your faith
 
Every man to himself
Figure out the ways of belief
The existence of denial
I could never be crowned in that pitiful way
 
Cursed souls, drenched in loss
Defeated by the ineffable force
To live in oblivion or die with pride
 
Burning lights flashes memories
Can't hold back, can't hold still
As I scream out the message:
No hope, no fear - this is the end of all!
 
Hear the screams of lost souls
Hear them begging for mercy
They lost the battle
They experienced the pain
 
Now is the time to harvest
Now is the time to collect
To see what you have conquered
And to send your soul: to hell!
 
Flayed bodies eyeless skulls
Inhumanity, the awaited fall
Feel the godless wrath
That heralds the end of all
 
Burning lights flashes memories
Can't hold back, can't hold still
As I scream out the message:
No hope, no fear - this is the end of all!
