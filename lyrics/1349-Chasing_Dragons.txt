1. Chasing Dragons
I am chasing dragons
Seeking the primal state of mind
Filling my veins with venomous lust
Awakening the beast inside
Seeking no meaning only feeling
Entering the shape of the beholder
And get ready to fight

An overwhelming attack of emotionless fury
Seek to trigger the fright inside
Conquer your fears and kill your courage
A mind seeking mission is on stake

Exploration of strength 
In mind, body and heart
An ultimate test of the 
presence of your being
Not to think 
Only act on instincts while you steer
into the face of your possible death
Sharpens you to the utter limits 
of consenus

So close but yet so far in presence
of this observation
Viewing this fight through primal eyes
Feeling neither good nor bad
A state of carelessness is what I am feeling

The pleasure of ultimate pain
Is sending warning light flashes

Of irrational behavior not humanly accepted
But humanity is no longer an issue
Irrational feelings are non-existing
The only reality is the ongoing fight

Coldness and grimness swarms to my blood
Regaining strength to fight on
When all the pain is gone and the wounds are healed
The awakening of a new chase is on for the strong

From beyond I have traveled
and to the end I will see
Enter the dragon
Causing its will to be mine
Pay the price of immortality and 
achieve victory to the mind

But the battle rages on..
