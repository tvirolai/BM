5. To Rottendom
[Music: Frost / Archaon, Lyrics: Destroyer]

Inescapable hell
Vomited from an impure soil
Riven with death
Like flies on rotten flesh
Hatred is carved onto this earth
On the bones of the dead
The fire of glory has long since faded

To rottendom
Onto rottendom

To rottendom
Onto rottendom

Into a pit of nothingness
Your soul laid bare
You all shall be none
Crawl back to your nest
Salt this earth with your dying sons

Feverish dreams of a world down in flames
Marching to the downstrokes
Of hells titan pistons

Exquisite execution
In a burning grip
The rotted life - blood drains away
Onto rottendom

Standing in mute judgement
Foul souls in bounds of iron
Harkening to the death watch
Hell is your cross to bear
Hell is your cross to bear!

To rottendom
Onto rottendom
