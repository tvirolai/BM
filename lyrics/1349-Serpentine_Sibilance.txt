2. Serpentine Sibilance
[Music: Archaon, Seidemann, Ravn, Lyrics: Destroyer]

Corpus Replica, Oath of the Black Tongue,
Man unkind in perfect unison,
Shapeless evil, touch the hell's fire,
The cloven death mass

Cold Logic, Devil and Vulture,
Back to the original sin,

There is no God, and we are his prophets,
Days will be eclipsed by leather wings,
Like ice-cold statues in a Labyrinth of Bone,
You stand to drown in tidal waves of sickness,

Fire-crested crouching shadows,
Skeletal requiem of death,
You come with the blackest tidings,
Leading the rats to our poisoned wells,

Cold Logic, Devil and Vulture,
Back to the original sin,
Cold Logic - Devils and Serpents,
Back to the cardinal sin.

Serpentine Sibilance
Incalculable Monochrome,
Phantom fingers unstitch time,
Serpentine Sibilance,
Unconditional harvesters,
Rattling bony fingers in the dark.

Have we come unbidden...?
The absolute tyrant of your flesh,
We came to taste forbidden fruits,
To boil your seas and burn your world.

Shadow fastened - Scorched into dry bone,
Under the Blood-Banner,
Spirit-raked, flagrant violation,
Harvest this world,
Serpents stare, all souls shadow,
The Black everlasting flames.

Ulterior motives - Walking nightmare,
Through the slime of age,
Spiritual dissection, twin-horned heathen,
Collective bile of millennia,
World incinerators - Raised by the infernal,
Through decades of slaughter.
