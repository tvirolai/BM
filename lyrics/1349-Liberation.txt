9. Liberation
As time floats by I'm stuck
on this point of no return
The world, a stage upon which
a neular play unfolds
flickering by in shades of grey
permeated by absurdity
like a glossy polished reality
slowly fading into oblivion

unconscious but aware
Awake, yet dreaming
Alive, still limbonic
Awaiting the liberation

The fallen angel of Doom appears
I behold his fury in fear
Disguised he enters the play
fulfilling the obscurity
I see the stage crumble
I see the curtains fall
the final act begins
as death reveals it's disguise

Escaping mankind, escaping doom
outrun (the) fear, outrun Death
Heading for the promised land
to gain immortality
Let the play of liberation begin anew

The circle is ended
a new play begins
no need to witness
know the end
Let all fears go by
drift into oblivion
