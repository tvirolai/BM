4. Celestial Deconstruction
[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Archaon]

In the end, a new era beckons
Settling the foundation of an infernal dimension of wrath
A revelation strikes with new awareness upon the masses
Veil of darkness unravel, a horrific sphere unfolds

An altering of the senses - to discover
What is behind light, beyond celestial slavery
Entangles the mind in dark waves, fiery & monotonous
Deep is the well of dark mystery

The enlightenment of madness presents itself
On the soil above a lower world
In everlasting ebony shades of the damned
Choirs of madness chant in agony, as blood
Flows furiously (through my veins)

Blurred visions - through a smoke-filled sky
With fists clenched, I gaze on through the ugly
The only right path

The surge of deconstruction casts light aside
The summoning at last
Deceiver - pioneer of this insight
Consume what is of joy

Consume what is of joy!

And endless rage until we dance on the hypocrites' grave
Step on the crucifix
Ans speak the tongue of blasphemy

The shivery
Crawling, freezing through the innards & up the spine
The separating of this shell of flesh
& a dark spirituality
Do I believe?
It believes in me
