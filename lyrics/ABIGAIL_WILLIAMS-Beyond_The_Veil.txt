6. Beyond The Veil
And a dark wind blows...
Empty vessels left scattered 
around the roads to nowhere 
and as we move past the darkness, 
I can't hear a word.
We've been trapped in the belly of a leviathan
but the beast is now bleeding out slowly into the cosmos.

The darkness
the sadness 
the sickness
the madness

washed away in a magnificent storm
The earth was beautiful on fire. Now purified.
These are truly the last days of time.
