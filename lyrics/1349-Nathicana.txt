2. Nathicana
[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Seidemann]

Goodbye o creature of folly
The sun still sheds light
On your towers
Of steel and glass

And they will bear silent witness
To the futility of your achievements
And the beasts will roam your streets
Feasting on your cooling flesh

Never again will your like be seen
Such arrogance and folly
The worm has conquered
And you return to dust

Millennia of evolution
Science and religion
Toil and suffering
Still you never learn

Now it is over
And how futile it all was
The dreams on mankind
Rotting away

And thus we all fade
Weep not for your destiny
No-one will be left to mourn
3000 AD
