9. Floods
[Music: Sorceron and Ellyllon, Lyrics: Sorceron]

A fortress of evil surrounded by darkness
I move through the shadows
I like the feeling of having you with me
The power of the ancient course through my veins as we
Drink from the everlasting fountains
We are gods in this state

I am your keeper
This is shelter
This is everything you've ever wanted
Ever needed
I am your keeper
In the eye of the winter
This is everything you've ever wanted
Ever needed
This is your sanctuary

Oh I cast my hand out and bring forth
The floods unto the lands
And cast away all amongst the living from the earth
May your spirits cry for all of an eternity
Though I'll hear them nay
There's but one refuge once the storm is summoned
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

I am your keeper
This is shelter
This is everything you've ever wanted
Ever needed
I am your keeper
In the eye of the winter
This is everything you've ever wanted
Ever needed
This is your sanctuary

Awaken the spirits
Returning your memories
Rescuing forever
Flood my soul with calamities
But my heart is beating me into reality
But now I'm leaving
I'll walk away from this
As the fire burns because these curses have no cure

I call out to the below
With hell in my eyes there's no turning back
I'll stay here forever
Your precious flesh is my only token of your memory
