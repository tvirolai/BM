2. Beyond The Apocalypse
An infernal madness sweeps me along
On a mind blowing trip to the utter beyond
Here I render chaos, not as force 
but as state
A state of a consuming and
conceiving mass
Pouring time into the endless hole 
of eternity
Letting forever be endless and the
end be forever

A fulfillinh vision of the ultimate
death machine
Harvesting beings through its emptiness
and void
Like scattered ghosts from lost dreams 
Filling a blurred fog of nightmares
Entering a state of the final 
consummation

And swallowing the poison from
the kiss of death
Utter apocalyptic grandeum
Revealing its majestic power
Manifesting its true will 
Through demonic slaves

One ruling force which is all
Nonegiving, all corrupting 
Both destructive and creative
A total mayhem of emptiness

To live as an Immortal
You must endure and explode life
And know what secret treasures await
Here..beyond the apocalypse.
