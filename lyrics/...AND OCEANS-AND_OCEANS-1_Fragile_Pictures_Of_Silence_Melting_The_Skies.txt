1. Fragile: Pictures Of Silence: Melting The Skies
The nights fall and skies fall
Down here we the sinners crawl
In dead cities and empty streets
All in ruins, but silence never sleeps

[Chorus:]
This world is fragile
Alone and silent
This world is fragile
And we are absent

Under melting skies - Into cold light
