3. Mirages For The Eyes Of The Blind
The light I see is none...
It doesn't shine, doesn't murder the dark
Was not created by the white one
Not existing for your undimensional eyes
The black I see in none...
Not a shattering, but a creating one
A spectrum of unreal colours
And a thrust for your numb existence
You are alive, I am not
You are dead, I'll never be
My face is an earthly mask I never asked for
So I'll leave it behind and will never return
Longing for worlds which my astral mind has seen
Here I stand, flesh and blood
Laughing and crying, betraying the earth
But have you really even thought this shell is me?
As your reality crashes into the void
I sit beside Satan and watch you die
