4. Maggot Fetus... Teeth Like Thorns
[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Destroyer]

Maggot Fetus,
Centipedal Slithering,
Sick Deformity,
Slow macabre devolution.

Teeth like thorns,
Carrier of plague and filth,
Leech-child,
Like the pested fly it's there.

Maggot Fetus,
Crawling underneath the skin,
Pestilence,
Only black-rot grows in here,

Breathing is a disgusting habit,
The decomposing mother-crones siren calls for death,
The necrotic flesh of the scum in her soul,
Clusters in decaying worm-holed bone barbs.

Teeth like thorns,
In hydra-headed multitudes,
Excremental decay,
In rotting postural flesh.

Maggot Fetus,
Rapture of the conqueror worm,
Blackest Venom,
The ghost in the carcass womb

Raven wings and Devil's Horns,
Black eyes waiting for the world,
Feel the cold seep into your bones,
Claws drilled deep into your marrow,
Black voided bowels bleeding out,
Like a vulture devouring from deep inside.

Teeth-like thorns,
Festering with ulcerous mouths,
Spine crawler,
Plague-bearing virus child.

Maggot Fetus,
Feeding on the dying soul,
Womb-Rot,
The sickening stench of death...
