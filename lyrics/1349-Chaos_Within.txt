3. Chaos Within
Your throats are empty and your words are shallow
You are too weak to understand that the time for revenge has come
I'll see your suffering, it is infernal
 
I will show you your faults
I will pound you till you fall
Your weakness enslaves you, binds you to your primitive thoughts
 
Kneel, as a slave before a master, for you the pain has just begun
You disgust me with your base existence
You're just apathetic excuse, not what they call: a man
 
You're just a soul in a human shell, not a soul with a true existence
I'll liberate you from this cage of flesh
Now is the time to fucking die
 
Die like a pig, die like a coward
Die like a mindless shell
Die like the rest!
 
I close my eyes, focus my aggression
Focus my will, reaching out with tendrils of hate
 
My mind's eye, burns your soul
Sears your flesh, caress you with deadly rage
 
I open my eyes, your corpse still burns
No match for my fiery hate!
Aggression abating as you wither:
