2. In Death Comes The Great Silence (Demo)
Another day passes by and
I am running out of excuses
Running out of words to describe...
And as my heart becomes dust
A final exit becomes clear
I stand beyond the sun with the comfort of emptiness inside

Because I could never swallow your false ideals
And I will never follow your god at the heels

Dark waters running deep as my hatred
Only the moon will witness my revenge
And the blood stained snow reeks of your invention
But in the loneliness of winter
I am abomination
Oh these words flow like the blood of mankind
Cold dreamless sleep is beckoning and in death comes the great silence
