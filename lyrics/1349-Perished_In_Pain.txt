5. Perished In Pain
I once had a vision
A visionof hell 
A clear blue flame
Burning throughout the universe
A massive force of ultimate evil
A destructive and tormenting flame
Wiping out all reason and sanity

An altering flame
A flame of corruption
So purifying and unholy
A withering maelstrom 
Of endless havoc
Reaping its way
Throughtout the endless chaos of life
If this is hell
Then hell is not the end

I long to behold the infinity
And to harvest its secrets
(so) I spit in the eye of fear
And set sail on a sea of fire
Black winds of doom
Bring me to my destined desire
There is nothing
Nothing for a human mind

Only oblivion
And mankind..Destined to Perish..in Pain

An infernal contamination
Of sickness and pestilence
Of this flame chaos is bred
And through this flame it is spread
Chaos lies in its wake.
