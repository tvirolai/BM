1. Manifest
For I have seen beyond the stars
I have felt the strength of chaos
I have reached the point of sanity
And was married by the Chaos star
I welcomed the darkness that filled my soul
I was blessed by the madness of the Chaos star

This is my destiny
The choices I have made
No hope, no fear
This is Manifest

If you could see through my eyes
You would see the things (of which) I speak
The point of sanity
And the mark of the Chaos star
I can show you the darkness that fills my soul
I can brand your empty soul with the mark of the Chaos star

This is my destiny
The choices I have made
No hope, no fear
This is Manifest

Do you dare to open your eyes?
And see what is out there?
Do you dare to close them again?
And see it reflected in your mind?

Do you know what to look for?
Or do you see what you want to see?
Is your mind open and free?
Or polluted by Christianity?

Do you speak your own mind?
Or the mind of the masses?
Do you practise what you preach?
Or are you full of shit!
Do you walk your own path?
Or do you follow a leader?
-This is our manifest of war
