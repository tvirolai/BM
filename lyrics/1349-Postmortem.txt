4. Postmortem
Inhuman postures
Testimony – Grotesque
Soul-disembodiment
Beyond the jaws of death
Skeleton pa-delirium (flesh in stasis)
Necrosis – Monolith
Spirit-disrememberance
Displayed in worm-born filth

The king of earth will gather and rot
Like carved meat on tainted ground

Nefarious monuments
Detesters – Obsessed
Post-mortem gallery
Vitrifying pillars of death

Grim-dawns – Through eternity's gilded halls
Shadowed by black tides of death
Gradually eroding to serpentine tones
Upon fertile lands turned to dust

Beyond the pylons of death and space
Staring from carnal cabinet-tombs
Endlessly gazing towards the apocalypse
Draped in aftermath and bloodlust-ruin

Sadistic necessity
Drove you from existence
Death epitomized
From in hell's embrace
In mute testimony
Condemned in remembrance
Cold absolution

Like predicaments of an insane saint
Far beyond grotesque and grimness
Their ghost-lips will forever gibber
To the sickening gust of future winds

Nefarious monuments
Detesters – Obsessed
Post-mortem gallery
Vitrifying pillars of death
