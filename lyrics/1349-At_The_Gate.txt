9. At The Gate...
[Music and Lyrics: Ravn]

Guided by the flame,
An image branded in your vision,
The infinite infernal incarnation,
Burning like acid in your mind.

Filling your eyes with absolute darkness,
Guiding your mind to envision,
Nothing more to be hidden,
In this darkness you can truly see...

Descending into the deep,
Consumed by the darkness,
Witnessing with awe,
The view that enfolds.

At the end at last,
The final destination:
Let it all begin,
Here at the gate of...
