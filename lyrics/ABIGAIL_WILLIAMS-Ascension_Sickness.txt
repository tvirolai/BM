1. Ascension Sickness
Dark clouds cover the sky blocking the pale illusive moonlight.
A false feeling of protection from that
which obscures the perceptional reality.

But am I not ready to see beyond the matrix
and surrender to the magnificence 
of my own being and embrace immortality?

Cold water lands upon my face drowning my thoughts 
and my flesh it does purify.

Tonight we roam in absolute darkness,
guided only by the light within.
Radiating.
