4. A Breath From Worlds Beyond
We are the ones in the mist
Are the darkness breed
We pity the one with the horns
And gaze at the hypnotizing starfire
Without words we communicate
Without battles we dominate
Wings for the wind, bones from the woods
One with nature, never alone
Our origin is unknown
Destination never shown
We never serve and never reign
Sacrifices for the stars, swords for the moon
Thorns and stones for your believes...
A cosmos with one colour but thousand shades
Universe of triumphant souls
For you not to feel, not to see
Your water is no blood
Your music no magick
Search beyond the stars
Nevertheless you can't find us
Our world does not exist
And we never lived
