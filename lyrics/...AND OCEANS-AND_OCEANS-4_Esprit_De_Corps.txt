4. Esprit De Corps
Seducer sun shine on me
Familiar scene, fever dream, hallucination
This beauty of paradise
Even pigs might fly
We're all mesmerised like flies 'round shit

[Chorus:]

Pigs, pigs, pigs
Esprit de corps
Pigs, pigs, pigs
You're the victims

Fertile sun, love of life
Philosophic suicide or cyanide
Illumination sunday sun sing tonight
Sing my cherub parasites
Gentle as lambs
Can be cursed by the light called sanity

[Chorus]

Mirage's your guiding star
Last breath before the dark
When your heart's in the mouth
I lead you up the garden path

[Chorus]
