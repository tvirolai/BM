5. Odious & Devious
The black iris devours pictures in silence
The image of devils light my consonance
The I of consolation
The eye of consolidation

Graves are the garden trees
Dead all flowers and so are we
Silent moves of the summer flies
Engraved clouds below divided skies
Insect influx, the scent of the dogs
My sweet flower, and insect on the cross

[Chorus:]

Darkly wise odour of the evil tongues
Odious and devious
I despise
Jinx of eden
Black paradise

Lips of times of secret 
Murmur evil sprouts
Purges the redeemer
Purge

The angel of voices
Injected by silence
Last breath of nails
Needles and icons
The eye of consolidation
The I of consolation
Taste the lips of ancient pleasures
Eat the fruit of darkly treasures

[Chorus]
