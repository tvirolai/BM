4. A Thousand Suns
[Music: Sorceron and Ellyllon, Lyrics: Sorceron]

Those treasured wisdoms were forgotten over time
Holds a message stolen from the stars where we live
In the shadows
Here in the womb of a thousand suns

The treasured wisdoms forgotten over time
Along the shore of the cosmos stolen from her embrace
And so we stay here waiting for the call
Waiting for the call

The current situation demands contemplation
War wages
The battle still rages on and on and on

This is what we were
This is what we have become
A reflection of purity cannot tell a lie
And as the sun fades on the surface of the earth
We are Hell-bound

Along the shores tonight
Scatter the ashes of a fallen empire
The time is nigh

Like blue mantles under the night sky
This night will last forever

They fell prey to the corruption, now they prey to the corrupted

This is what we were
This is what we have become
A reflection of purity cannot tell a lie
And as the sun fades on the surface of the earth
We are hellbound
