8. Malediction
With iron and ice running through my veins
I curse upon the day you became 
Consequences...
You run from your fate but your guilt enslaves you
Weaving destiny and fate
No longer will we wait
Malediction
It will be done
If naught within this night of splendor
Be this my destiny
They came to plant the seed of hate within me
Each day grows stronger
Blacking out the rays of the sun
Blind you with hatred
In emptiness I am free
Look towards the sky
You will suffer my will
A pitiful shattered wretch are you that envies those of the dead
Your rest eternal
Taken to the place where birds they do not sing
The wind blows the truth  and with the rain
Comes the sent of change
