4. Infernal Divide (Demo)
As the daylight withers
And night falls over the earth
Weltering in sadness
Over a bitter loss
You are the tragedy
You are the land of no return
I will watch the sky for a sign
Will you wet the earth
When you weep from above

Rain pours down like wisdom
Awakening the sleeping
We have waited an eternity for the return
When they shall rule again

My existence
Infernal divide
A monumentum of the past
Descending
