6. Acid Sex And Marble Teeth (You-Phoria)
...and still I dream about the colors

Or was it smoke that surrounded my thoughts
When I was sitting in my garden

That black Monday (momentaaninem
pimeys, melankolian i√§isyys)

Brought flowers and silence, but that
sunshine is in another aspect
Nothing But a verbal virus when I welcome the clouds...
Sub specie aeterni I still am the mechanic hippie
And the outside is reflected inside me... well
Am I the shadow of myself, coz I really
Don't believe in the empty shadows (but
When I believe then and only then I
Believethat I am not I) but it's nice
And relaxing to stand naked by the
window watching heaven's children falling
As rain (samalla kun piirtelen viivoja
veteen ajatusten merenpinta laskee
alle normaalitason)
...but after all take what is needed, so
children forget heaven...
