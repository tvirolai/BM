4. Eye To Eye At Armageddon
Unable to save the world
But able to suffer in this so-called heaven
Your grotesque vision of pure holyness
Will be suffocated like you - bearer of light
Cry bearer of light
To weak to fight
Your fear - Your death
Eye to Eye at Armageddon

You say god is strong
You say god is eternal
I say this are lies

Unable to save the world
But able to suffer in this so-called heaven
Your grotesque vision of pure holyness
Will be suffocated like you
Cry bearer of light
To weak to fight
But we meet again - Eye to Eye
Victory at Armageddon
