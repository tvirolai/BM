2. Atomic Chapel
"The ancient whispered secrets
Massed into nuclear skies
Seek the unholy, in the darkest of places
Cryptic equations light the madness in or eyes"

Unholy radiance - Nuclear Necropolis
Pariah Leper-cult - In atomic bliss

Black towers rising
Under a skeleton scythe

Thermo-cardinal hexe
Sworn by phantom quires

Radiation witch fire - Spreads like cyclonic whips
Genocide war cult - Convoking the merciless blitz

Dark prayers recited
Drifting through acid winds
In endless repetition
Like an everlasting paramount sin

Unholy prophecies - Apocalyptic radiance
Death-weaving carrion cult - Thermonuclear contempt

Skeletal towers rising
Through ammoniac storms
Towards a rusted altar
The congregation worms

Spiritual parasite - Atomic high-priest
Suicidal death-cult - Holocaustic feast
Omega necro-messiah
The ancients whispered your name
Merciless soul-corruptor
The wrath of old poisons will reign

Atomic Chapel - Haereticus, amen fiat voluntas tua
Atomic Chapel - in nomine mori
Atomic Chapel - Revoco minaciae ultimum
Atomic Chapel - Lex Diaboli
