7. Blood Is The Mortar
And then we back them down

Soulbound-human heid
Walking in the shadow of hell
At the hands of a sadist
Cast into pandemic years
Into utter night
Into darkness absolute

Bring them into fire
Strap them down among the bones
Heided to the slaughter 
Through a maggot coated world
Through a tunnel of knives
Like an angel in a devil's den
Crawling out of the slime
(you) insectoid vermin

Bound upon the wheel of hell
See your neck upon the blades
Into utter darkness
Into impurity and hate

Massacre a dark paradise
Blood is the mortar
Forged upon bones of death
Infernal eternal infamy
Blood is the mortar
Lay waste this world in blasphemy

Through hasty pillars of green light
Through clouds of carrion flies
Let the world see me drag you to hell
And your soul wrenched from your body

It fills my heart with fury
Like a storm of brooding doom
To relish in the bloodspill
Worship your own butchers
Rising piles of the dead
From atop a mountain of skulls

Soulbound human heid
Deathmass in necrotic delights
Inhuman ritual tormentors
Rising in full majesty

Thirst for retribution
Spikes driven into flesh
Into utter darkness
Into a violent storm of death
