7. I Wish I Was Pregnant
What if the case was...

The candle is burning once again
Like the faces of black and white children

...the girl in every man...

a long abortion is what life is
Long as a shadow filled with emptiness

Like the shadow of a shadow
Life is fading away like a dying flower

If I could
I would rape myself
If I was pregnant
I'd give birth to myself and my own death

...the man in every girl...

Innocent (Innoceant) and young
Swallowing myself and the inner sun (son)

Like the shadow of a shadow
Life is fading away like a dying flower

...but that's not the case yet, or...
