10. The Departure
[Music: Sorceron and Ellyllon, Lyrics: Sorceron]

I will ride again
Beyond the moon wandering
In the land of the dead I am a king

Of these negative forces
Reclaim the earth and burn down the heavens
A god who's kingdom lays within
But the cruel frosts and wintry winds
Make it difficult for me to protect you from the cold
These icy shores are never

Ending this perennial cycle
And if I'm not back by dawn please call my name

Run into the night
Your snow covered heart is dripping away but mine is
Shattering in the coldest of winds


Ellyllon -- Keyboards
Samus -- Drums
Bjornthor -- Guitar
Plaugehammer -- Bass
Mike Wilson -- Lead Guitar
Sorceron -- Vocals
