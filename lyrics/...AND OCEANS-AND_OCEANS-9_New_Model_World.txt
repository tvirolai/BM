Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy

Intelligence is sexy

Stuck in a junction of transparent corridors
Multifarious structures and intricated patterns
Lost in a jungle between indexes
A paradian of systematic metroplex

Synchronize
Sensitize
Stigmatize

2. White Synthetic Noise
Inhale/exhale
Inhale the exhaled
Inhale/exhale
Inhale the injected voice
Inhale/exhale
Exhale the inhaled
Inhale/exhale
Inhale the lines of white noise

Silence depicted the room
And released the liquids in drops
Infinity licks the tongue of thorns
And devours the cities in drone

These designers of syndromes
The core of poison free sound
Slowly drifting to the mind of dub

Gardens swallow the idyllic life
Inhales heavens to earthly eyes
Open palms of autumn scars
Adieus to plaintive solar charm

3. Tears Have No Name
Under the dark sky we stand
Under heavy rain we walk
Your hand in mine, my eyes in tears
Here where heaven is forgiven
Here where tears have no name

[Chorus:]
Wet as rain
I kiss your tears
Tears don't cry
They have no name

As the dark water pours down
We grow like wild summer roses
With no sun in sight
No footsteps left behind
All this love built on pain
Still the tears have no name

[Chorus]

The last touch of your cold lips
That light, that warm desire
Through the holes of the night
We slide in the night
In oceans of heaven
The tears have no name

Our eyes filled with black tears of heaven
Flowers drowned in the darkening oceans
In solitude we all do the same
Coz our tears have no name

The angel of my dream
Carried away to the stars
Hurt by your cruelty
I breath your beauty
Alone in the rain
With tears that have no name

4. Esprit De Corps
Seducer sun shine on me
Familiar scene, fever dream, hallucination
This beauty of paradise
Even pigs might fly
We're all mesmerised like flies 'round shit

[Chorus:]

Pigs, pigs, pigs
Esprit de corps
Pigs, pigs, pigs
You're the victims

Fertile sun, love of life
Philosophic suicide or cyanide
Illumination sunday sun sing tonight
Sing my cherub parasites
Gentle as lambs
Can be cursed by the light called sanity

[Chorus]

Mirage's your guiding star
Last breath before the dark
When your heart's in the mouth
I lead you up the garden path

[Chorus]

5. Odious & Devious
The black iris devours pictures in silence
The image of devils light my consonance
The I of consolation
The eye of consolidation

Graves are the garden trees
Dead all flowers and so are we
Silent moves of the summer flies
Engraved clouds below divided skies
Insect influx, the scent of the dogs
My sweet flower, and insect on the cross

[Chorus:]

Darkly wise odour of the evil tongues
Odious and devious
I despise
Jinx of eden
Black paradise

Lips of times of secret 
Murmur evil sprouts
Purges the redeemer
Purge

The angel of voices
Injected by silence
Last breath of nails
Needles and icons
The eye of consolidation
The I of consolation
Taste the lips of ancient pleasures
Eat the fruit of darkly treasures

[Chorus]

6. Of Devlish Tongues
Night swells to distant spheres
Silent throat of unholy times
The withering wind deep down here
Flesh of the gods bleeding as light

Here in the environs of heaven
The am sun am outshined one
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony

Forever people suffer in silence
Always and forever drifting to dark waters
The sand of time, still ominous
As scultured cherubs of the ether
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony

"The am sun, my ebony sun"

Erratic firmament and the perishing clouds
Descending angels, formless divine
To inherit light and silence, so profound
The devlish eyes of the reptile

Here in the environs of heaven
The am sun am outshined one
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony

7. Postfuturistika
Opulent kinetic sculptures
Visualized voices in motion
Plastic puppet pictures
Audial dances distortion

Dead stars, dead stars
Oh yes we are dead stars inwards

I am the pulse of achromatic idols
The fix of cyclic icons
In the land of nod
The orb of angels 
And the horns after gods 
Adored through a needle

Opulent kinetic sculptures
Visualized voices in motion
Plastic puppet pictures
Audial dances distortion

Dead stars, dead stars
Oh yes we are dead stars inwards

In the land of nod
The orb of angels 
And the horns after gods 
Adored through a needle
