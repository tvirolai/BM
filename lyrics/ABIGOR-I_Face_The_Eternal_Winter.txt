7. I Face The Eternal Winter
Flying silent on winter wings
Flowing emotions from my bleeding soul
Tears that flow burn my skin
I'm drifting away on the cold wave of desolation
I'm touching the wind as it sadly sings
Carried to the disant unknown
Eternity awaits me...
My heart is so cold
Emotions reached their freezing point
...Only pure hate
Lost all that I was living for
Crying without sound
Thy sky has frozen to ice
As the last drops of blood leave my body
I hear the winter breath
I'm the face of the night
I'm all alone
The fullmoon is glowing
Snow falls from the sky
I feel the eternal winter
Holocaust winds are rising
Like a dark northern breeze
My cryptic journey has just begun
