5. Pitch Black
Dive into the primitive side
Seek the beast within
Forget all emotions and forget all rules
Let the animal come to life

I welcome you to a world beyond limits
Where nothing is as you know it today
A desert of death and destruction
Pray that only the suns make day

To reach this land you must travel far
Into space, beyond time
Leave civilisation behind and prepare for
Survival of the fittest / a world of 3 suns

Behold the desert through nocturnal eyes
The endless day / the night pitch black

Eclipsing the suns from the world
Leaving darkness and fear behind
Creatures rule this world
Hunt you down in the dark
Cling to the light and trust the strong to survive
This place is no place for humans
Only creatures get by

I welcome you to a world pitch black
