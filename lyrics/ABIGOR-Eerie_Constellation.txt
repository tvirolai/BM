2. Eerie Constellation
As the wan moon - the 6th of the hidden
Takes his position
My body trembles in blasphemic delight
Obsessed I awaited this day
As the planets arrive
And unveil the powers of ages for me
...Surrounded by a beam of light
The seven stars burn in line
I chant the first words of wisdom
And the earth is covered in deepest blackness
Mankind falls into chaos
Everything returns to it's origins
I use a wand of silver
To draw the lines in the air
I use a wand of gold
To reign in blood and fire
For this is the time to channel my forces
To purify the surface of my planet
All celestial bodies form an almighty sign
Eerie constellation is a beginning
Eerie constellation is an end
