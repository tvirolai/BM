10. The Devil Of The Deserts
Do you know me?
Do you awaken screaming my name?
Do the images of me linger
into your waking hours?

I am the eternal dream
The unreachable goal
that which you strive for
But never achieve

I am your desire
Your deepest wish
And greatest fear
I am your nightmare

I whisper to you
Like the buzzing of insects
Secrets of the desert

You tell me all your wishes
Your innermost dreams
And hope to see them

I see your nightmares
Drink them in
And refine them

I give you
Your nightmares back
And your screams never stop

Somewhere in the desert
Your screams echo
Like the buzzing of insects

Be now the djinn
While I roam in the world
In your skin

Do you know me?
Do you awaken screaming my name?
Do the images of me linger
into your waking hours?

I am desperation
The love lost
But always longed for
I am despair

I am the dark
When all light is gone
And you are alone
I am your destiny

I am life!

I give you
Your nightmares back
And your screams never stop

Somewhere in the desert
Your screams echo
Like the buzzing of insects

Be now the djinn
While I roam in the world
In your skin
