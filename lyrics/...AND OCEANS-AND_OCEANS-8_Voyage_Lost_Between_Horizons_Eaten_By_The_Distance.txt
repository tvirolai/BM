8. Voyage: Lost Between Horizons: Eaten By The Distance
Time drips in passionate decay
Lost between eternities' scent
Sun burns brighter every day
Flaming fires like nails of torment

[Chorus:]
No place to crawl - no space to fall

A moment of clarity
Devoured by purity
Voices swallowed by hunger
As death shines brighter
All images drowned in eyes
Into light under melting skies

[Chorus]
