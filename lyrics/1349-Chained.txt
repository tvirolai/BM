7. Chained
Wrath-storms of perpetual darkness
Carve this realm from flesh
Raise your typhoon-wings of blight
Scouring the humans stench
Wicked-born – Not of heaven
Spawned into a cold abyss
Baptized in screaming voids
Draped in sacred bloodshed
Pure resentment clad in flesh
Chained to rotswarms
Anchored to this vision of hell
Chained to rotswarms

Divine wrath – In unbound fury
Breathing howling clouds of ash
Succumb to the abhorrence
Like yellow poison pumping through flesh
Infesting upon titan ruination
Chained to rotswarms
Through pungent veils of death embrace
Chained to rotswarms

Mover of great unearthly flesh-tides
Speak with all the voices of the abyss
Call upon blasphemy everlasting
With feral hunger like a depthless pit

Nemesis – Locust storm exlipse
Pitched into unholy darkness
Bound to the carrion-call
Chained to rotswarms

Pure resentment clad in flesh
Chained to rotswarms
Anchored to this vision of hell
Chained to rotswarms
Infesting upon titan ruination
Chained to rotswarms
Through pungent veils of death
Chained to rotswarms
