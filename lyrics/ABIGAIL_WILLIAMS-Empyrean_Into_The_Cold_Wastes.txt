8. Empyrean (Into The Cold Wastes)
[Music: Sorceron and Ellyllon, Lyrics: Sorceron]

Oh in the night skies
Turns a darkness that will enlighten
All of mankind as we know
And it will glow with so bright a light showing us
A clear path once invisible

But in the stage of decay...
Enshrine the forgotten secrets of the earth
Buried by angels in starlit chambers
This is the sound; listen for the sound of the trumpets
Through the eyes of creation
I see the final stages of decay
Beneath the burning palaces of heaven
And into the pits of sands
I watched the kingdom come crumbling down

Wrought their own destruction
Subterranean origin
Cataclysm casting the world into the dark
The winds of wrath are howling into the cold wastes
