1. From A Buried Heart
Gaze to the darkened skies
This will be my last night
Trapped in this mortal shell
And as the body decays
The flesh becomes one with the earth from which it came
And as I open my eyes illuminated I wake...
At the gates of the abyss my blood ran cold
Hearkening to the death but before I take to the ground
Unburden my soul relinquish my heart...
The grace is no bar to my call...
These blossoms beloved won't last forever
I'm afraid my last breath stands frozen
And if I shan't see you again as shares of the evening drew on beyond our depths
