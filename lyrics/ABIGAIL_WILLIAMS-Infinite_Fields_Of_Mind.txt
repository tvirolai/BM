4. Infinite Fields Of Mind
How time stands still
Despite our withering world
I am enchanted by the nocturnal winds.
Still in the emptiness and silence
Heart beating in time to the rhythm of the endless sea
No longer searching
No longer wandering the empty lands in the blood of whter
I walk in shadows
What shall be will be
Before the dawning of the day I'll fade away
Truth exists in nothing and nothing exists outside the mind

Conduit closing
