2. Slaves
Devolving backwards with glorious abandon
Delirium – In a gilded cage
Aching like an open wound
In consecrated disillusion
Man crawls back into the slime
Like carrion upon carcasses of slaughtered beasts
Successors – scraping at your gates
Spine broken underfoot in rotten evolution
Drowning in eternities of neglect
Constant and eternal
As it carved into the flesh of earth
Under the sovereign-doctrines
The inner iron-discipline

The slaves shall serve
Chaos reign supreme
The slaves shall serve
In corrupt insanity
The slaves shall serve
Alone in decrepitude
The slaves shall serve
In reverse spirituality
The slaves shall serve
Chaos reign supreme
The slaves shall serve
In corrupt insanity
The slaves shall serve
Alone in decrepitude
The slaves shall serve
In reverse spirituality

In piles of bone building towers to the sky
Kneeling – In dying contemplation
Spitting the futile prayers
Towering to be closest to the gods
In spineless submission
Swarming under isoclinic cromlechs of death
Culling – mormillion opiate-masses
Resting on the laurels of mass graves
Climbing gold mountains, in disposable waves

The slaves shall serve
Chaos reign supreme
The slaves shall serve
In corrupt insanity
The slaves shall serve
Alone in decrepitude
The slaves shall serve
In reverse spirituality

Rot of humanity
As their males birth’ death and female hyenas
Under disciplinary-suffering
The inner strata-discipline

The slaves shall serve
