6. What Hells Await Me
What hells await me 
Riding the violent winds of time
Chasing visions along the way
Am I forgotten
Well my death won't be in vain
My existence is shattered and the lights go dim
The end of days
One thousand worlds I would cast away to escape
When the curtains fall down
upon the darkened plains
What hells await me
This moment stands eternally
Staring down my own demise
Fear and awe consume me as I discover my own mortality
I am taken to the place where the angels do not dwell
To the kingdom of dis
We will meet again at the gates of eternal slumber
And with you in my dreams I am dying to sleep eternal
My body lies cold but my soul forever burns
