7. Legion
Like a ghost I wander
Withdrawn from reality
becoming a misanthrope
summoning spirits to me
fighting humanity
no need to watch my back
for they are fighting with me

[Chorus:]
We match into war slaughtering mankind
If you try to stop us we will give you hell
(from which we came)
join us if you dare
fight us if you can
Choose sides,
or escape to survive

Blood red is the sky
Blood red is the earth
Blood red are the rivers and mountains
that we pass
Black smoke fills the air
from the corpse pyres around
burning mankind
and have it buried underground

[Chorus:]
Their funeral pyres, lighting the earth
Smoke blots out the sun, creating eternal night
gone is humanity, trampled to the ground
suffocated by the ashes, utopia of thy design

Lend us your sword
and ours will be yours
Give us your strength
and receive it thousand told
The demon army
marching over forth
fulfilling the vision
an untained world

Don't oppose us... resistance is futile
we annihilate all enemy forces
Nobody can stop us now
defeat of mankind, a victory of
misanthropy
