7. An Echo In Our Legends
Enslaved to the dim light
Betrayed by a god less exonerating
Infernal inquisition
Behold the might
The path we tread

Towards the shores of ice so cold and unforgiving

Oh angel of death
Covered inn sin

Bound to the dim skies from which it all began
From the heavens descend
And like an echo in our legends do illuminate us to pour craft divine
Arise!

I call upon the gods immortal
Mold us one with your darkness
In the shelter of the night here exists endless beauty abound
