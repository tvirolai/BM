3. Tears Have No Name
Under the dark sky we stand
Under heavy rain we walk
Your hand in mine, my eyes in tears
Here where heaven is forgiven
Here where tears have no name

[Chorus:]
Wet as rain
I kiss your tears
Tears don't cry
They have no name

As the dark water pours down
We grow like wild summer roses
With no sun in sight
No footsteps left behind
All this love built on pain
Still the tears have no name

[Chorus]

The last touch of your cold lips
That light, that warm desire
Through the holes of the night
We slide in the night
In oceans of heaven
The tears have no name

Our eyes filled with black tears of heaven
Flowers drowned in the darkening oceans
In solitude we all do the same
Coz our tears have no name

The angel of my dream
Carried away to the stars
Hurt by your cruelty
I breath your beauty
Alone in the rain
With tears that have no name
