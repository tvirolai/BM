3. Aiwass Aeon
The last millennia were dedicated to
the forces of light
of selfrighteous hypocrisy
of denial and Puirtanism

Deceit and despair
Futuristic paranoia
Visions from a dark millennia

Where god has failed
and mankind shouts
and kills with joy

a bloody holocaust of flesh protects 
the earth

Not the times have changed 
mankind has thrown
of its morals and laws

social Darwinism
to the extreme
weed out the weak 
and soon the liberation will come
Pitiful humans did you believe,
The aeon of Aiwass was for you?
