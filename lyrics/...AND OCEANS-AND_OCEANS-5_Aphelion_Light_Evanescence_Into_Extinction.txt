5. Aphelion: Light Evanescence: Into Extinction
It's a crime - it is a crime to be innocent
In life - in this life and presence
All life - all life is indifferent
Now's when - when all's past and gone

[Chorus:]
Turn away - fade away
Turn away - fade away

It's a crime - it is a crime to be silent
When colours - when colours have no nuance
You little - you little insects
Splashed out - splashed out of all essence

Fade away - fade away
Fade away - closer every day

[Chorus]
