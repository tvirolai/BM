4. Infernal Divide
As the daylight withersand night falls over the earthWeltering in sadnessOver a bitter lossYou are the tragedyYou are the land of no returnI will watch the sky for a signWill you wet the earthwhen you weep from aboveRain pours down like wisdomAwaekening the sleepingWe have waited an eternity for the returnWhen they shall rule againMy existenceInfernal divideA monumentum of the pastDescending
