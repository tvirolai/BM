7. Battlefield Orphans
We loaf around the fireplace
War-weary and calm
We watch the sunrise motionless
The war has been won
[repeat]

We hear melodies unsung
Mesmerized...

We survived - but why?
A new beginning - for what?
Too cooled down to move
We just stare and lay back to die

The holocaust is over - victory
All is dead - burnt debris
Everlasting silence - we reached peace of mind
We just stare and lay back to die
