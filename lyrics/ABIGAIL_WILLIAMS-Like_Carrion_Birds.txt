2. Like Carrion Birds
This place holds within its walls a profane legacy
It's sickening my soul
A monument to darker ages
Behold two thousand years we burn the memory
Twas such a beautiful site
The flames wrought tears from my eyes
To the beating of my dreadful heart
Peering into the dark to the dungeons of her hope
Thine is this portion of my flesh
Will you wreak your sorrow on me forevermore?
On this sombre starless night
You've wandered from the safety of thy mighty shores
From the cold tombs heart the spectre
Washes away we overturn the graves of gods who told lies
Feed as if time has fallen deathly still
My passions my sorrows mere memories of a life past
But I've come too far to just walk away from my empire
The ashes from the fire still litter the earth
In my wake an infinite sadness towards finite endings
Blessings from below the curses to the above
