4. Emptiness
Hell is real - I feel its presence

Staring with empty eyes
Into an empty sky
Nothing is here to feel

I drift like a falling leaf
The wind takes me into the unknown
Where is all the hate
All the pain

Staring with empty eyes
Into an empty sky
Nothing is here to feel

I drift like a falling leaf
The wind takes me into the unknown
Where is all the hate
Just pure devastation to darkness
