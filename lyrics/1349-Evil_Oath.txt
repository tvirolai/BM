8. Evil Oath
Riding the wings of the unholy wind
to be carried to an eclipsed place of
chaos
To be taken far away from holy ground.
Away from the falling Christ and his
father

As nights and days passes, till we turned
to dust

Series of simple gestures make me
perish,
as I said farewell to light an god of
disillusions
To follow thee into darkness which i long
for
The source of fire, always burning in my
heart

I hereby give you ME,
to declare WAR!
I bare no regrets for these actions,
I fulfill them with pride, I worship all that
is ours.
Joining the mach of the even fall.
To be at your disposal, the blade when
you release damnation
I fulfill these actions with pride, I worship
all that is ours.

Open the gates, greet me welcome
Independence carried me away from lies
and hypocrisy
The god of sickness and his sickening
angels
To reach a new aeon, which I seek...

As nights and days passes until I've
turned to dust
My soul is thine to cleanse, to form
To shape like thy signs of yours
