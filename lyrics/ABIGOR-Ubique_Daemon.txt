6. Ubique Daemon
On the path of immortality - I walk
I am forever with the stars so plentiful and bright
The gorgeous victory of sheer energy and matter
This is my constellation - reflected in you fear
Through dark tangles of mountainsides I descend
And no other God is as strong as I am
I am Satan...
The lustrous and overwhelming scorn
Mein Schattenbild aus einer zeitlosen Welt
Wird sich manifestieren
And all I see, as I stand above this ancient landscape
Is the horror and death that awaits you...
My wings flare in the cold wind
The delicious stench of blood make me laugh
And for one moment I've felt harmony
As I've seen mankinds end...
