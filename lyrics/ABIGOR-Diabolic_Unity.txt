8. Diabolic Unity
My lord, I say I'm yours
You're my mentor

I'll learn to take control over mankind
I'll be the leader of your unholy legions

To your victory on earth
We will your enemies the christians

My lord, I say I'm yours
I say I'm your's, my lord I'm yours

Speak the ancient words to cause the eclipse
Embalmed in black receive thy might

In sin we live
In sin we die

Join force Belial
Satanic unity
Meet us out there

Forests pride, moons beauty
Satans power, journey's end
Eternal darkness
