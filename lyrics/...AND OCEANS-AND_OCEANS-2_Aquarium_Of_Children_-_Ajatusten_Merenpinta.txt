2. Aquarium Of Children - Ajatusten Merenpinta
Like stones in silence I stand
As I draw circles in the sand
Naked under blue glass
Drowned I watch children dance

In a mind of an echo

(I know that I am I, if and only if I
believe that I am I)

I float to the distance to eat the horizon
I cut the sunbeams the day before tomorrow
Tranceform the time to a silent history
Run under water in eternal serenity

...is it easy to run
to run under water?
...is it easy to paint
to paint without colors?

I float to the distance to eat the horizon
I cut the sunbeams the day before tomorrow
Tranceform the time to a silent history
Run under water in eternal serenity

(If i would've been the other I
and if I would've wanted to be the other I
then I could've been I)

...is it easy to run
to run under water?
...is it easy to paint
to paint without colors?

As an echo in the mind
