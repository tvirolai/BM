6. Opaque: The Morning I Woke Up Dead: Today Is The Day
[Chorus:]
Today is the day - the world is going away
Today is the day - we're all going away

When will we dream away; end this life in dismay
See the last sad rays, as flowers we wither away

[Chorus]

When will time eat us away; our dead faces portray
Turn all of us cold and grey, the years will sweep us away

[Chorus]
