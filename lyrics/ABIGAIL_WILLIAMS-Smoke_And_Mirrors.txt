6. Smoke And Mirrors
[Music: Sorceron, Lyrics: Sorceron]

In a dark corner of the room she sits in silence
Behind the mask of beauty lies the truth
Taken away

The land has suffered under your heedless reign
There is no end

The land has suffered under your heedless reign
Where is the end?

Your love is like a sea without a shore

You wear the crown of shadows well my friend but the
Truth of the matter is,
Your stranger then a stranger in a strange land

Your love is like a sea without a shore
Your love is like a curse holding me under its terrible spell
I should not be there

You wear the crown of shadows well my friend but the
Truth of the matter is,
Your stranger then a stranger in a strange land
I tried to reason
I tried to comprehend
This is treason
