6. From The Deeps
[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Seidemann]

Ia! Ia!
The stars are rights!

For aenos they have slumbered
Dead but dreaming
Waiting beneath the waves

Awaken!

Daemon-gods of primeval times
Coming round full circle
Stirring in the deep

Rise! Rise! Rise!
Boiling wasters part
Cyclopean cities emerge
From the deeps

And then...

Insanity and fear
Overwhelm the humans
Outnumbered and inferior

Kraken, Leviathan, Cthulhu
So many names given
To the fear from the deeps...

Awaken! Kraken
Awaken! Leviathan
Awaken! Cthulhu

Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!

From the deeps...

Ia! Ia!
