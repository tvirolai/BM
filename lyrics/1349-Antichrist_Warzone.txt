2. Antichrist Warzone
To break the barriers of every man's hope
Just show him: reality
Just give him a glimpse of what's beyond,
The lies of sanity
Just show him the lies spun around
Their so-called "normality"
I'll offer you nothing but the simple truth
Just based upon what your eyes can see
 
There is no heaven, there is no hell
The only truth as you can see it for yourself
So trust nobody but yourself
For that's the only thing you can know that exists
And die with dignity
 
Thoughts and memories come toward you
Reminds you of your loss and curse
Loss of past, curse of future
You decide what your life should be like
Stop wasting your time and energy
On those unworthy of your affection
The only thing certain is the presence of your being
And like this it will be till the day you die
 
A significant life through other eyes who see
As meaningless as there can be for me
Hope replaced by hatred
I've never been closer to the "truth"
I'm truly expressing "gratitude"
True thoughts of an atheist
 
I'll swear to the one that even darkness fear
With a sharp conscience
Risen through lost faith
I'm every drop of hate!
 
Asking myself why they fear death
When all I fear is endless pain
 
Can't find a reason in this mess called life
There's no solution as easy as the one I give you
Just a shot gun with a single blast
 
Or face reality
And face your own fears
And grow stranger
And die with dignity
 
This is how I remind you of my presence
 
Attraction
Rejection
 
Self destruction
Satisfaction
