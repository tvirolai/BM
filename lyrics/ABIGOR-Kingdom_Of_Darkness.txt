2. Kingdom Of Darkness
His kingdom - Kingdom of Darkness
Where you can hear agony screams
Cry eternal
Frozen moon, growing shadows
Glowing eyes are waiting
(The) creator of darkness will rise
And the sun will shine no longer
Cry eternal
Condemned to walk away in the night
In the land where cold winds blow
Where silence reigns
From horizon to horizon
The wind leads your way
Darkness fills your soul
You'll be eternal in his kingdom
Kingdom of Darkness
Embalmed in black
Receive thy might
Our sense of live to harm world
Under the shining moon
We follow your command
Entering your unholy path
Kingdom of Darkness
