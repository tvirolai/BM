5. Baby Blue Doll - Merry Go Mind
I (even if I should be in plural) am the
Singular dimension
The repeated phrase of a lost section
Where the circle (the actual box of colors)
Is completed
The mindjourney, the merry go mind

Draw the lined in water - divine the innerwold
Inside the outside of the merry go mindstop

I (...and not the others of I) painted the words
To a context, a mind absurd

With the baby blue doll under my arm

Draw the lined in water - divine the innerwold
Inside the outside of the merry go mindstop

Eyes the parade of the air
From a transparent perspective:
We are the spheres

Feel the warm magma inside
In veins the stream of honey
colors ascend to the mind
I greet the blue harmony

...only then
I (...and not the singular I) will believe in
The empty shadows, but...
