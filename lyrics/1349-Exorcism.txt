3. Exorcism
Crystal silence
Upholding the law
Of the tarnished dark clouds
Thousands and thousands inflicted
– Driven by them demons
Their strong sudden impact
– Wired directly to the (under) world below

Termination
Of a million possessions
Termination
– Circulating in patterns
Terminating
A million possessions
Terminating
– In their own prosperity
The Termination
Of a million possessions
The Termination
– Brings the monster to time

Like spacestorms through centuries
– Holding, wild and furious
An eruption that no one can prepare for
They persist for aeons
Aeons after aeons

Termination – Circulating in patterns
Terminating – In their own prosperity
The Termination – Of a million possessions
The Termination – Brings the monster to time

Forming bonds
Temple of power
Cosmo eternity
As lightning breaks the silence

Despair, the mouth of fire swallows all
Fear, of the commitment of the soul

Chalice of impure spirits
For the incursion of all infernal adversary
Every legion, congregation and sect
The master of deceit
And enemy of man's salvation
