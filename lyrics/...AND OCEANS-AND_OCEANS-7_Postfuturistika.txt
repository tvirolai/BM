7. Postfuturistika
Opulent kinetic sculptures
Visualized voices in motion
Plastic puppet pictures
Audial dances distortion

Dead stars, dead stars
Oh yes we are dead stars inwards

I am the pulse of achromatic idols
The fix of cyclic icons
In the land of nod
The orb of angels 
And the horns after gods 
Adored through a needle
