8. Pandemonium War Bells
Black Sky
Dead sun
Life-less

Cold orbit
Un-creation
Planet king

Through the infinite halls of hell
The Pandemonium war bells chime

The shadow point
Hell unleashed
Dark death

Rotten stars
Suns collide
A dying world

By the light of collapsing stars
The Pandemonium war bells chime
Hell, is reaping over paradise
Cutting golden chasms through nebular skies
Dead worlds fill my vision
Out from a starless void

Like a slow eternal glacier
A million eons old
Rotting pulsars bring eternal night
The Pandemonium war bells chime

Cataclysmic apocalypse rise
Crusading into damnation
Eons passing by as seconds
No night has ever been this black

A ceaseless flow of darkness
Paint this world in black
Unravel us all into chaos
Rip the fabric of time and space

Universal evil
Hell precedes this dawn
Planet carnivore
The raping of a dying world

Cosmic anarchy
World incinerated
Nebular overlord
A testamental judgement
An unstoppable momentum
Devoid of sentiment
Through dark dead galaxies
Hell has been unleashed
