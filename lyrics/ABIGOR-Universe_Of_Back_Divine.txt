1. Universe Of Back Divine
The holy trinity is rotten
All the saints are slain
Religion is forgotten
To the winged demon-lord we pray
We will rule -
If not now, than in eternity
Maybe you win in this world
But the universe of black divine
Remains immortal
Get one of us in this reality
We sacrifice hundrets of yours
In our true reality -
Hell
The dark age is our aim
To rule of mankind
This worthless brainless piece of shit
That remained of gods ridiculous creation
Our unit shows the sign of Satan
The master in black
Obey or be obliterated
