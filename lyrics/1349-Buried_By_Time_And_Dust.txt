10. Buried By Time And Dust
[Mayhem cover]

Visions of that no mornings
light ever will come
I'm to old now
The dark is so near,
will I ever reach
the land beyond
This is where we go when we have to
die!

I've been old since the birth of time
Time buried me in earth
centuries ago, I tasted blood
Buried by time and dust
Many years has pasted since the funeral
Missing the blood of human throats
so many years, ages ago
I must await, feel my bodies
stench

Wanderings out of space
Wandering out of time
A world out of light, death at the end
Only silence can be heard, silence of peoples tears
No one knows my grave
Buried by time and dust
