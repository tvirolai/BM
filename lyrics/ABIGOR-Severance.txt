8. Severance
Not a senseless life - but extinguished now
This is the long awaited end

Not pain - a sort of harmoney I feel
As I look back - staring at my body
Lifeless - but not without bearing
Realizing that the mission is done

As I leave the earth I'm not alone
All the brave warriors who fought on my side
Fly with me to our last place of rest

Is it the silvery shine of the moon that surrounds us
Or is it the path to the halls of eternal glory

Never thought to be so calm
As my soul leaves this dimension forever
Never to return
But wrapped in knowledge we found fulfillment

Forever...
