8. Internal Winter
I was alone
The path lay before me
Illuminated by the blood of those
Who went the hard way

Silence oppressive
Death imminent
Chaotic evil
Raping the order
Killing the light

Submit to your fears
Obsessed with your faults
Surrender to the darkness within
Initializing Armageddon
End of transmission

No way to recapture the feeling
Cannot reclaim a crumbled throne
Cursed with awareness
Of a time that has died

Detached I sever the bonds
Adoring my shell with crimson threads
Attuning my flesh to my spirit
Revealing in the agony

Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold..all the way..in.

My breath is chill
My blood is ice
My embrace the freezing death
Frozen to the core
Subzero emotions
So cold it burns

Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold..all the way..in.

Massa di requiem per tellus
Arranged for choir and flesh
An eldritch chaos of demon cacophony
Such sweet disharmony
Almost sacred
In its blasphemy

So let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold all the way in.

Now..
To rest
To die
Sleep..
Perchance to dream
Of nightmares and coffin-worm

Such sorrow, then
To wake up
To be alive
Not dreaming
In a corpse city beneath the waves.
