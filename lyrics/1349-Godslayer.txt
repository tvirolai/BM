8. Godslayer
The knife that cuts through the veil of sanctity
And exposes to poisonous ream of the hypocrite whores

The shovel that digs in the soil of holiness
And exhumes the rotting corpse of the false savior
The strike that obliterates the firmament of righteousness
And brings down the disease-ridden angels of perverted purity

The lamp that lights up the path to paradise
And reveals the black hole of oblivion
The hand that feeds the dogs of reason
And unleash the hounds of hell

The bringer of the satanic current
The morning star that shines
On the dawns of the black hearts

Marvel of Blasphemy
