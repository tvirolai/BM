
1. In Hindsight
De-evolution for thousands of years
Consolidates all my fears
Ignoring the real issue
Stop bothering about pity human scar tissue
Diminish our earthly waste
Finished in haste
Earth turned into a cold-blooded corporation
What about the future generations?
In hindsight we should be brave enough
To surrender and realise
That the consequences will be tough
And at the end our demise
What is it with our digital existence?
Why do we cling with such persistence?
Exploring alternative ways of living
A greater gift our world we are fiving
We see in hindsight
That the future is not bright
Let the green militia reign
Our most important refrain

2. Disintegrate
Conflict to the final end
Consider if you should function as a fraction or drown in the attempt of making an action
Straight to hell and back, being in the midst of a crowd
No wonder violence are back in rack
Better stand still or shout it out loud:
Disintegrate the different, it gives meaning in order
Cut off the radical, close any border
Fuck the controversial could ideology ever be shorter?
Ever wondered how to reflect as an independent?
So, when did individualism become the crime?
An instruction should follow consequent
Hell, I am gonna make it all a fucking rhyme
So for now, close eyes and become the participated
Play the pity game
Disintegrate the different, it gives meaning in order
Cut off the radical, close any border
Fuck, the controversial, could ideology ever be shorter?

3. Ways Of The World
Lack of motivation? At every occasion
Tell me, did you earn your name?
So why did you reckon it would bring you fame?
Lack of understanding? It's kind of demanding
So then, did you earn your respect?
I'd rather say you suffer from a defect
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, it will at least bring humility
For all what it's worth - past glory
I bring no comfort
Lack of dedication? That's why I'm on medication
Well, how did you ever earn your integrity?
You're nothing but a failure in eternity
Lack of measures? I never found any treasures
Now, how did you get your crown?
For me it'll represent the lake in which you'll drown
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, at least it will bring humility
For all it's worth - final cut
I will keep my mouth shut

4. Subversive Faith
The man withdrew from the fire
With a twitch in his face
Hey, could you describe for me your personal faith?
My request is inconclusive
The endeavours all lost
The efforts numerous to heal it at an cost
I detest you my good man for being so easily susceptible
Reckless as it may have been
Passing on judgement as it would seem
Interfering with personal beliefs
Being a scholar among thieves
Hey man, one last chance; speak the truth or hold up your hands
Subversive faith - blinded by fools
A demise that is far too late
All for a book that is nothing but full of rules

5. Cold Grave
A ferocious circle of fiends
A paragon to follow
A derisive laughter, created by winds
No wonder everyone thought it was hollow
A place for everything
Grace me with sleepless nights
A time for anything
Praise me with clear-cut fights
A dead end street
Shut your bedroom and block herein
Lift and uncover your sheet
Addictive like goddamn heroin
The chasm of reality
Sanctions through folly
Still no overdrive capacity
Never seen anything so holy
This is the night of the cold grave blues
Be sure it's all wrapped well and tucked
I ain't got no short fuse
Hell, this is when we'll all be fucked

6. Vile Ritual
Recite the unspoken
A manifest of the Great Self
A solid faith in what you can accomplish
A supreme vision of capability
An arcane text
Describing an outrageous test
Too bold the modern ones would say
You can always pray
A vile ritual bleeding
Like a spear of hate
Almost like the predator's feeding
Consolidating every man's fate
Oh venerable ancestors
Please grant me with my pagan fest
I'm equal to my human contester
May it be a fight for all the best
Would the few of us ever accept
A moral that is slightly trite?
A sun that never sets is still being bright
Small pieces of heathen soil can make any man's blood boil
A violation of anything supreme has come into regularity in any scene
Never condone the residue of human scald
Boiling in water that is still cold
A modern day heresy it would be in fact
Just let me have my vile ritual intact

7. Underdog
When telling the fable of men
The Demise of lies
Let the Underdog be the narrator
Behold the kingdom's rise
Always being held down, the weaker part
You see, that's the state of the art
Father from truth, further from sight
So whoever yelled "might's right"?
A glimmer from the past
The stronger can easily fabricate
A life ending so fast
Anything impious you'll ever advocate
A glint of truth, a vision of rectitude
Whoever took that as bad attitude?
The Underdog will forever remain the unofficial hero
Pictured in a golden covered frame

8. Wrenched
In the yard of the old man
The ruin's shimmering
The world's painted pale
The conditions are at stale
Flocks gathered from far away
Hiding, still overly aggressive
Generations they will slay
Not really regressive
A dead end cave
Home of the brave
The world fools no one
Grace me with hammering rest
Keep an eye on the sea
Imagine what we would be
Rushing to the shores
God of all damn wars
Wrenched beyond recognition
No such thing as human intuition
Feel free to turn the supreme ignition

9. Vulture
Throbbing; The vast deceiver
Underdog, god of all men
Crushing; bone and skin to the ground
Dying, but still vital
Where would it head me? Fresh, yet rotten to the core
Would you ever join me?
Howling; heresy to the end
Tribe and unit; one of a kind
Searching; but nowhere to find
Does that make sense to you?
Walk alone or all fly
One watching the other die
Simple, cold and awaiting
You'll never stop hating
Hell on earth
Was it what I wanted? A peaceful mind
Rejoice with me
Vulture - may I take your shape?
Vulture - tell me of my fate
Vulture - your kingdom come
Vulture - take me home
