2. Deduced to Overkill
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

Ultra death, hardcore trash; give me your call. 
Holy death, in presence of which I gave you it all
Conformity through terror, rapture through restrain. 
It's like putting your life all down the drain.

Godflesh; how do you cope? 
A leap out of faith, time to find the rope. 
Deadmeat; look into my eyes, 
how could you possibly believe the lies?

Deduced to Overkill, defunct totality. 
An abstract netherworld with no absence of fundamentality. 
It is where you will be. 
Existentialism - living hell - condemned to be free
