11. Obeyer's Of Their Own Deaths
Self-destruction towards the true enemy within, it's the only battle you can win.
Other wars, you don't stand a chance.
Turn the weapon and turn the cause upon yourself, failing to advance.
Digging your grave is another way of shitting on this earth.
You are the disease waiting to be spread.
Hurt yourself to rebel, falling into the trap.
