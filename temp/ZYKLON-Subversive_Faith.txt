4. Subversive Faith
The man withdrew from the fire
With a twitch in his face
Hey, could you describe for me your personal faith?
My request is inconclusive
The endeavours all lost
The efforts numerous to heal it at an cost
I detest you my good man for being so easily susceptible
Reckless as it may have been
Passing on judgement as it would seem
Interfering with personal beliefs
Being a scholar among thieves
Hey man, one last chance; speak the truth or hold up your hands
Subversive faith - blinded by fools
A demise that is far too late
All for a book that is nothing but full of rules
