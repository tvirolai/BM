8. Electric Current
Worlds onto planets, existence built on faith
We are the generation of the earth, mastered at any rate
We are the people of the stars, mansions of the moon
Come take us home where we belong
Take us home once and for all

This is what we agreed on in plenum,
Resulting in defection through vacuum
Sanctions through my ever-lasting philosophy
Ideology starting from within
Ending in our mind-created brave new world

Withdrawal from the world,
Returning to the final firmament
Children of a proclaimed mind-pattern
Victims of mental cosmos and winter

Worlds onto planets, existence built on faith
We are the generation of the earth, mastered at any rate
We are the people of the stars, mansions of the moon
Come take us home where we belong
Take us home once and for all
We will never return again
