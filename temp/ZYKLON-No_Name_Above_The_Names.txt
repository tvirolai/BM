5. No Name Above The Names
Planets beyond numbers; worlds concealed by faith
Our thoughts will turn the sublunary worldview straight
Order in chaos from an indefinite system
One step mistaken and the great scale is broken

Every star, a world of its own
The earth being the greatest of them all
Movement from alienation to reconciliation
A subject of degradation

These illustrious worlds and all the more
Considered as being the inner core
The full creation leaves a geocentric treasure
Make yourself grow to greatness beyond measure

A universe built on corporeal centre and boundary
Do you conceive the impossibility?
Religion turned freelance, no name above the names
It's all build on your feeble frames
