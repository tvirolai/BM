Stereogothic void - predestination of being. 
Psychothronic schizoid - conditioning the future. 
Past without content - life without meaning

The New World Inc. executes standardization 
   in a futuristic framework of sterility. 
Why is everything so constant? 
Why doesn`t things change? 
You`ll never be alone again.

Patterns of dominant contraception displaying. 
The New World Inc. deciding your mental agenda. 
Creations of a disillusioned mind. 
Never forsake the Providence; 
the mind-altered herald. 
Deathlike silence - cyber scenario turns the ego.

Inbred conveyer - psychedelic vultures disrupting the social order. 
Segregation, still no reason to inhale the dirt. 
No sivilization without stability, 
no individual equilibrium without emotional equality.

Stereogothic void - predestination of being. 
Psychothronic schizoid - conditioning the future.
It`s nightfall and world-wide disinfection. 
It`s a Z-kloned syndrome revealing spirituality as something absent. 
You`ll never be alone again.
