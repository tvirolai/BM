1. In Hindsight
De-evolution for thousands of years
Consolidates all my fears
Ignoring the real issue
Stop bothering about pity human scar tissue
Diminish our earthly waste
Finished in haste
Earth turned into a cold-blooded corporation
What about the future generations?
In hindsight we should be brave enough
To surrender and realise
That the consequences will be tough
And at the end our demise
What is it with our digital existence?
Why do we cling with such persistence?
Exploring alternative ways of living
A greater gift our world we are fiving
We see in hindsight
That the future is not bright
Let the green militia reign
Our most important refrain
