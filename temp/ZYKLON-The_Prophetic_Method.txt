6. The Prophetic Method
A synthesis of collective existence
A dialectic of the old order and the new world
Demise; a fall of Absolutes
Imminence; a choir of celestial flutes

Discontinuity between the two domains
Forever and always reigns
Plain logic strategy, it will be
Simply psychology, as anyone can see

Deconstruction, a tool for demonising
Credibility and hope find itself rising
Reconstruction; it demands authority and action
By which the population will only see a fraction

Social constructionism; questioned through all times
Just like the fall of shattered mines
The prophetic method; liminal and in between worlds
Challenging the symbolic order, listen as it hurts
