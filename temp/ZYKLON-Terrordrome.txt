6. Terrordrome
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

What can be heard of the sentiment of soilent green?. 
The B-29 Bomber, Enola Gay; a personified Grim Reaper, 
leaving behind a mushroom-cloud and heavy ground haze, 
a manmade eclipse,creating a constant defunct totality. 
Hell on earth, who`s to blame for erasing an entire society?

The crushing shockwave, man`s plutonium implosion, 
wounding the surface like a dying prey. 
Black carbonised concrete, distorted metals, 
appearing like deformed burned skeletons. 
Boiling exhalation, melted glass, 
twisted scrap iron as grotesque deadlike trees, 
portraying man`s ability to annihilate himself. 
Everything has become nothing in just a moment of time.

What remains is a sight that no man has ever seen. 
A graveyard with not a tombstone standing. 
An inconceivable testimony of human ill-will. 
The greatest deed ever in a world never to rise again.
