13. The Darkest Light
Silence now and close your eyes,
this is the darkest light you will ever see.

Waiting not for death to drown in purgatory,
waiting now for death, bringer of the only solace.

Don't be confused,
you've lost all there was to lose.

Survival only seeking...another fate worse than death.

Suspended in a state of oblivion,
A key to the exit is death.
