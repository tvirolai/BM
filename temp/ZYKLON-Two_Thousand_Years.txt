4. Two Thousand Years
Two thousand years of unrealised eschatology
No hold for divine dispensation
Obey through my external service
Value my redemptive power

Feel so much gratitude,
Only levelled by relative magnitude
Chiliasm proved by doctrinal code
Millenarism to be established by utter instinctual mode

Two thousand years of morals as figure,
Taught individually by example
Never share with me your disclaims,
Picture only what you're worth
In all your incompleteness

Condemnation could only be revealed through liberation
Apocalyptic as in clear-cut context
No more words needed, final result is man
As he shall ever be; striving, acting and suffering
