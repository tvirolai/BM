7. Specimen Eruption
Growth; is that what it takes?
Disintegration; a world full of snakes
This is Machiavellian Strategy,
An extensive form of tragedy

Evolution; countercharge the ambivalence
Devolution; create your own malevolence
No more mercy, hold your mind
A culmination of which anything you won't find

Origin of a concealed fate,
It means we cannot go at any rate
This is death, this is life
Is this what existence all will be like?

As pitiful as you will ever be
Open your eyes and you will finally see
My omnipotence, no more accessible
It will only make you more feeble

Challenge; constraint of my aggression
Only obtained through concession
Response; obey through authority
I could only conform to negativity

Origin of a concealed fate
It means we cannot go at any rate
This is death, this is life
Is this what existence all will be like?
