3. Chaos Deathcult
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor/ T. Akkerhaugen]

Esoteric knowledge about the last of things. 
My sweet eschatological vision. 
Foundation for the renewal of the world, 
immemorial sins, never redeemed. 
Suppressed, oppressed, never redeem again. 
The sulphur-kingdom, purgatory, hell`s damnation, 
no man will be perditioned for all time.

Where is your millennium? 
Where is your kingdom of a thousand years? 
What you see is a world of hate, of pitiness, 
never again to be set in state. 
What you see is what you get.

Evolving chaos, death the inevitable force
It`s your cult, your mission

Misery - a necessary evil
Sympathy - a tool for fools
Death - the ultimate function
Mercy - a waste of grace

Every man is therefore guilty of all the good he did.
