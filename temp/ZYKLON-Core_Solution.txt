2. Core Solution
Default by any means - competence and skill
Keep acting like you care still
Gathered in pride, howling of joy
Why don't you realize you're short of a decoy?

Illusion - Hibernation of mind
Retribution - one of a kind
In all honesty; no failure in breed
No one would never let them be freed

Constitutional right? - A fucking lie
An even fight? - not in a lifetime
A single individual and no one cares
A whole of community and everyone fears

Core solution or anything that matters
Core revolution and anything shatters
Nature's self throbbing by human impact
Off the shelves, never to regain in fact
