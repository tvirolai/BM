3. Ways Of The World
Lack of motivation? At every occasion
Tell me, did you earn your name?
So why did you reckon it would bring you fame?
Lack of understanding? It's kind of demanding
So then, did you earn your respect?
I'd rather say you suffer from a defect
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, it will at least bring humility
For all what it's worth - past glory
I bring no comfort
Lack of dedication? That's why I'm on medication
Well, how did you ever earn your integrity?
You're nothing but a failure in eternity
Lack of measures? I never found any treasures
Now, how did you get your crown?
For me it'll represent the lake in which you'll drown
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, at least it will bring humility
For all it's worth - final cut
I will keep my mouth shut
