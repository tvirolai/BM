
1. Psyklon Aeon
Congregation unity; faint as your ideology
Concentrate all in sterility
Morals runs riot in an endless variety
Of fragmentary post-solidarity

Never share the effort, symmetry in lines
Will the Providence ever grace you from all the lies?
Dishonour any corruption, favour only redemption
Voluntary subordination, engage in contemplation

You base it all on hierarchy
No wonder it'll turn into fucking anarchy
Detachment of continuity
Revolving around an ever growing susceptibility

Heading towards the Psyklon-Aeon
The last analysis will forever be perishable
That's how we would execute any cosmological society
On behalf of further reliability

This is all what your life is worth
You better pray it'll be short

2. Core Solution
Default by any means - competence and skill
Keep acting like you care still
Gathered in pride, howling of joy
Why don't you realize you're short of a decoy?

Illusion - Hibernation of mind
Retribution - one of a kind
In all honesty; no failure in breed
No one would never let them be freed

Constitutional right? - A fucking lie
An even fight? - not in a lifetime
A single individual and no one cares
A whole of community and everyone fears

Core solution or anything that matters
Core revolution and anything shatters
Nature's self throbbing by human impact
Off the shelves, never to regain in fact

3. Subtle Manipulation
Subtle manipulation, it all comes down to accommodation
Integrity of belief, integrity of behaviour
You reckon they are your saviour?

A generation of no return, howling, it becomes eternity
In a brief history of time
Does it at any rate indicate your maturity?

Disown the disorder; what about your past?
Negate and agitate; did you hope it would last?
Mind-control terminology at any level
Be sure they'll disconnect the rebel

Did you comprehend the vast chain of being?
Did you reach the inner (other)-worldly council?
Draw into yourself all the sensation
And see if it is your collective nation

Subtle manipulation, it all comes down to accommodation
Integrity of belief, integrity of behaviour
You reckon they are your saviour?

4. Two Thousand Years
Two thousand years of unrealised eschatology
No hold for divine dispensation
Obey through my external service
Value my redemptive power

Feel so much gratitude,
Only levelled by relative magnitude
Chiliasm proved by doctrinal code
Millenarism to be established by utter instinctual mode

Two thousand years of morals as figure,
Taught individually by example
Never share with me your disclaims,
Picture only what you're worth
In all your incompleteness

Condemnation could only be revealed through liberation
Apocalyptic as in clear-cut context
No more words needed, final result is man
As he shall ever be; striving, acting and suffering

5. No Name Above The Names
Planets beyond numbers; worlds concealed by faith
Our thoughts will turn the sublunary worldview straight
Order in chaos from an indefinite system
One step mistaken and the great scale is broken

Every star, a world of its own
The earth being the greatest of them all
Movement from alienation to reconciliation
A subject of degradation

These illustrious worlds and all the more
Considered as being the inner core
The full creation leaves a geocentric treasure
Make yourself grow to greatness beyond measure

A universe built on corporeal centre and boundary
Do you conceive the impossibility?
Religion turned freelance, no name above the names
It's all build on your feeble frames

6. The Prophetic Method
A synthesis of collective existence
A dialectic of the old order and the new world
Demise; a fall of Absolutes
Imminence; a choir of celestial flutes

Discontinuity between the two domains
Forever and always reigns
Plain logic strategy, it will be
Simply psychology, as anyone can see

Deconstruction, a tool for demonising
Credibility and hope find itself rising
Reconstruction; it demands authority and action
By which the population will only see a fraction

Social constructionism; questioned through all times
Just like the fall of shattered mines
The prophetic method; liminal and in between worlds
Challenging the symbolic order, listen as it hurts

7. Specimen Eruption
Growth; is that what it takes?
Disintegration; a world full of snakes
This is Machiavellian Strategy,
An extensive form of tragedy

Evolution; countercharge the ambivalence
Devolution; create your own malevolence
No more mercy, hold your mind
A culmination of which anything you won't find

Origin of a concealed fate,
It means we cannot go at any rate
This is death, this is life
Is this what existence all will be like?

As pitiful as you will ever be
Open your eyes and you will finally see
My omnipotence, no more accessible
It will only make you more feeble

Challenge; constraint of my aggression
Only obtained through concession
Response; obey through authority
I could only conform to negativity

Origin of a concealed fate
It means we cannot go at any rate
This is death, this is life
Is this what existence all will be like?

8. Electric Current
Worlds onto planets, existence built on faith
We are the generation of the earth, mastered at any rate
We are the people of the stars, mansions of the moon
Come take us home where we belong
Take us home once and for all

This is what we agreed on in plenum,
Resulting in defection through vacuum
Sanctions through my ever-lasting philosophy
Ideology starting from within
Ending in our mind-created brave new world

Withdrawal from the world,
Returning to the final firmament
Children of a proclaimed mind-pattern
Victims of mental cosmos and winter

Worlds onto planets, existence built on faith
We are the generation of the earth, mastered at any rate
We are the people of the stars, mansions of the moon
Come take us home where we belong
Take us home once and for all
We will never return again

3. Chaos Deathcult
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor/ T. Akkerhaugen]

Esoteric knowledge about the last of things. 
My sweet eschatological vision. 
Foundation for the renewal of the world, 
immemorial sins, never redeemed. 
Suppressed, oppressed, never redeem again. 
The sulphur-kingdom, purgatory, hell`s damnation, 
no man will be perditioned for all time.

Where is your millennium? 
Where is your kingdom of a thousand years? 
What you see is a world of hate, of pitiness, 
never again to be set in state. 
What you see is what you get.

Evolving chaos, death the inevitable force
It`s your cult, your mission

Misery - a necessary evil
Sympathy - a tool for fools
Death - the ultimate function
Mercy - a waste of grace

Every man is therefore guilty of all the good he did.

5. Cold Grave
A ferocious circle of fiends
A paragon to follow
A derisive laughter, created by winds
No wonder everyone thought it was hollow
A place for everything
Grace me with sleepless nights
A time for anything
Praise me with clear-cut fights
A dead end street
Shut your bedroom and block herein
Lift and uncover your sheet
Addictive like goddamn heroin
The chasm of reality
Sanctions through folly
Still no overdrive capacity
Never seen anything so holy
This is the night of the cold grave blues
Be sure it's all wrapped well and tucked
I ain't got no short fuse
Hell, this is when we'll all be fucked

2. Core Solution
Default by any means - competence and skill
Keep acting like you care still
Gathered in pride, howling of joy
Why don't you realize you're short of a decoy?

Illusion - Hibernation of mind
Retribution - one of a kind
In all honesty; no failure in breed
No one would never let them be freed

Constitutional right? - A fucking lie
An even fight? - not in a lifetime
A single individual and no one cares
A whole of community and everyone fears

Core solution or anything that matters
Core revolution and anything shatters
Nature's self throbbing by human impact
Off the shelves, never to regain in fact

2. Deduced to Overkill
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

Ultra death, hardcore trash; give me your call. 
Holy death, in presence of which I gave you it all
Conformity through terror, rapture through restrain. 
It's like putting your life all down the drain.

Godflesh; how do you cope? 
A leap out of faith, time to find the rope. 
Deadmeat; look into my eyes, 
how could you possibly believe the lies?

Deduced to Overkill, defunct totality. 
An abstract netherworld with no absence of fundamentality. 
It is where you will be. 
Existentialism - living hell - condemned to be free

2. Disintegrate
Conflict to the final end
Consider if you should function as a fraction or drown in the attempt of making an action
Straight to hell and back, being in the midst of a crowd
No wonder violence are back in rack
Better stand still or shout it out loud:
Disintegrate the different, it gives meaning in order
Cut off the radical, close any border
Fuck the controversial could ideology ever be shorter?
Ever wondered how to reflect as an independent?
So, when did individualism become the crime?
An instruction should follow consequent
Hell, I am gonna make it all a fucking rhyme
So for now, close eyes and become the participated
Play the pity game
Disintegrate the different, it gives meaning in order
Cut off the radical, close any border
Fuck, the controversial, could ideology ever be shorter?

8. Electric Current

1. Hammer Revelation
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

A depiction of the lamb, the lion, deplorably portrayed. 
The beast, the dragon, as in shadowy imagery, 
have the power to take away peace on earth. 
The threshold's here as the sun turns black, 
the moon red like blood and stars falling down. 
Babylon falling, the last of the antagonistic battles, 
the madman chained for a thousand of years. 
Use your eyes and you will see it, bright and shining. 
A moment of your time, a glimpse of your (brave) new world

Your revelation, in apocalyptic terms, 
the hammer, separating fiction from reality. 
Embrace the notion, embrace the moment. 
Who are the ones to tell the truth, 
who are the ones to tell what to believe? 
The depiction is therefore all you`ve got.

The hammer is mine, the revelation is yours. 
Am I God or am I the Devil? 
It`s a comprehensible, yet complex, reality, 
because it means that when the past has caught up with the present, 
we have no future.

1. In Hindsight
De-evolution for thousands of years
Consolidates all my fears
Ignoring the real issue
Stop bothering about pity human scar tissue
Diminish our earthly waste
Finished in haste
Earth turned into a cold-blooded corporation
What about the future generations?
In hindsight we should be brave enough
To surrender and realise
That the consequences will be tough
And at the end our demise
What is it with our digital existence?
Why do we cling with such persistence?
Exploring alternative ways of living
A greater gift our world we are fiving
We see in hindsight
That the future is not bright
Let the green militia reign
Our most important refrain

5. No Name Above The Names
Planets beyond numbers; worlds concealed by faith
Our thoughts will turn the sublunary worldview straight
Order in chaos from an indefinite system
One step mistaken and the great scale is broken

Every star, a world of its own
The earth being the greatest of them all
Movement from alienation to reconciliation
A subject of degradation

These illustrious worlds and all the more
Considered as being the inner core
The full creation leaves a geocentric treasure
Make yourself grow to greatness beyond measure

A universe built on corporeal centre and boundary
Do you conceive the impossibility?
Religion turned freelance, no name above the names
It's all build on your feeble frames

1. Psyklon Aeon
Congregation unity; faint as your ideology
Concentrate all in sterility
Morals runs riot in an endless variety
Of fragmentary post-solidarity

Never share the effort, symmetry in lines
Will the Providence ever grace you from all the lies?
Dishonour any corruption, favour only redemption
Voluntary subordination, engage in contemplation

You base it all on hierarchy
No wonder it'll turn into fucking anarchy
Detachment of continuity
Revolving around an ever growing susceptibility

Heading towards the Psyklon-Aeon
The last analysis will forever be perishable
That's how we would execute any cosmological society
On behalf of further reliability

This is all what your life is worth
You better pray it'll be short

3. Ways Of The World
Lack of motivation? At every occasion
Tell me, did you earn your name?
So why did you reckon it would bring you fame?
Lack of understanding? It's kind of demanding
So then, did you earn your respect?
I'd rather say you suffer from a defect
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, it will at least bring humility
For all what it's worth - past glory
I bring no comfort
Lack of dedication? That's why I'm on medication
Well, how did you ever earn your integrity?
You're nothing but a failure in eternity
Lack of measures? I never found any treasures
Now, how did you get your crown?
For me it'll represent the lake in which you'll drown
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, at least it will bring humility
For all it's worth - final cut
I will keep my mouth shut

4. Subversive Faith
The man withdrew from the fire
With a twitch in his face
Hey, could you describe for me your personal faith?
My request is inconclusive
The endeavours all lost
The efforts numerous to heal it at an cost
I detest you my good man for being so easily susceptible
Reckless as it may have been
Passing on judgement as it would seem
Interfering with personal beliefs
Being a scholar among thieves
Hey man, one last chance; speak the truth or hold up your hands
Subversive faith - blinded by fools
A demise that is far too late
All for a book that is nothing but full of rules

5. Cold Grave
A ferocious circle of fiends
A paragon to follow
A derisive laughter, created by winds
No wonder everyone thought it was hollow
A place for everything
Grace me with sleepless nights
A time for anything
Praise me with clear-cut fights
A dead end street
Shut your bedroom and block herein
Lift and uncover your sheet
Addictive like goddamn heroin
The chasm of reality
Sanctions through folly
Still no overdrive capacity
Never seen anything so holy
This is the night of the cold grave blues
Be sure it's all wrapped well and tucked
I ain't got no short fuse
Hell, this is when we'll all be fucked

6. Vile Ritual
Recite the unspoken
A manifest of the Great Self
A solid faith in what you can accomplish
A supreme vision of capability
An arcane text
Describing an outrageous test
Too bold the modern ones would say
You can always pray
A vile ritual bleeding
Like a spear of hate
Almost like the predator's feeding
Consolidating every man's fate
Oh venerable ancestors
Please grant me with my pagan fest
I'm equal to my human contester
May it be a fight for all the best
Would the few of us ever accept
A moral that is slightly trite?
A sun that never sets is still being bright
Small pieces of heathen soil can make any man's blood boil
A violation of anything supreme has come into regularity in any scene
Never condone the residue of human scald
Boiling in water that is still cold
A modern day heresy it would be in fact
Just let me have my vile ritual intact

7. Underdog
When telling the fable of men
The Demise of lies
Let the Underdog be the narrator
Behold the kingdom's rise
Always being held down, the weaker part
You see, that's the state of the art
Father from truth, further from sight
So whoever yelled "might's right"?
A glimmer from the past
The stronger can easily fabricate
A life ending so fast
Anything impious you'll ever advocate
A glint of truth, a vision of rectitude
Whoever took that as bad attitude?
The Underdog will forever remain the unofficial hero
Pictured in a golden covered frame

8. Wrenched
In the yard of the old man
The ruin's shimmering
The world's painted pale
The conditions are at stale
Flocks gathered from far away
Hiding, still overly aggressive
Generations they will slay
Not really regressive
A dead end cave
Home of the brave
The world fools no one
Grace me with hammering rest
Keep an eye on the sea
Imagine what we would be
Rushing to the shores
God of all damn wars
Wrenched beyond recognition
No such thing as human intuition
Feel free to turn the supreme ignition

9. Vulture
Throbbing; The vast deceiver
Underdog, god of all men
Crushing; bone and skin to the ground
Dying, but still vital
Where would it head me? Fresh, yet rotten to the core
Would you ever join me?
Howling; heresy to the end
Tribe and unit; one of a kind
Searching; but nowhere to find
Does that make sense to you?
Walk alone or all fly
One watching the other die
Simple, cold and awaiting
You'll never stop hating
Hell on earth
Was it what I wanted? A peaceful mind
Rejoice with me
Vulture - may I take your shape?
Vulture - tell me of my fate
Vulture - your kingdom come
Vulture - take me home

7. Specimen Eruption
Growth; is that what it takes?
Disintegration; a world full of snakes
This is Machiavellian Strategy,
An extensive form of tragedy

Evolution; countercharge the ambivalence
Devolution; create your own malevolence
No more mercy, hold your mind
A culmination of which anything you won't find

Origin of a concealed fate,
It means we cannot go at any rate
This is death, this is life
Is this what existence all will be like?

As pitiful as you will ever be
Open your eyes and you will finally see
My omnipotence, no more accessible
It will only make you more feeble

Challenge; constraint of my aggression
Only obtained through concession
Response; obey through authority
I could only conform to negativity

Origin of a concealed fate
It means we cannot go at any rate
This is death, this is life
Is this what existence all will be like?

4. Storm Detonation
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

Manifestation of the Storm Detonation. 
Abandonment, renunciation, nuclear abrasion. 
Maximum reality, ultimate reality. 
What do you long for, Doomsday or Alienation?

The first and the last of global warnings, 
as in withered ill-willed spirit. 
Psychic dweller, 
fearing the lies that surround you like a mental grip.

Aborticide as altruistic moral. 
Backflashes from a past that once was, 
memories from another day. 
A depleted human race. 
An echo that reflects and consolidates the super-humaneous will. 
Will to Power, 
Call to Power.

Utopian abattoir, a derisive reality. 
Clouds, embracing the highland of earth, 
as shadows from another time, 
predicting the depredations of Terra Mater.

Tell the tale of a grand magnificent new world. 
Tell the tale of a thousand years. 
Tell the tale of the Storm Detonation, 
manifested in every fatalistic soul, 
asking if you want Doomsday or Alienation

3. Subtle Manipulation
Subtle manipulation, it all comes down to accommodation
Integrity of belief, integrity of behaviour
You reckon they are your saviour?

A generation of no return, howling, it becomes eternity
In a brief history of time
Does it at any rate indicate your maturity?

Disown the disorder; what about your past?
Negate and agitate; did you hope it would last?
Mind-control terminology at any level

Subversive faith - blinded by fools
A demise that is far too late
All for a book that is nothing but full of rules

6. Terrordrome
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

What can be heard of the sentiment of soilent green?. 
The B-29 Bomber, Enola Gay; a personified Grim Reaper, 
leaving behind a mushroom-cloud and heavy ground haze, 
a manmade eclipse,creating a constant defunct totality. 
Hell on earth, who`s to blame for erasing an entire society?

The crushing shockwave, man`s plutonium implosion, 
wounding the surface like a dying prey. 
Black carbonised concrete, distorted metals, 
appearing like deformed burned skeletons. 
Boiling exhalation, melted glass, 
twisted scrap iron as grotesque deadlike trees, 
portraying man`s ability to annihilate himself. 
Everything has become nothing in just a moment of time.

What remains is a sight that no man has ever seen. 
A graveyard with not a tombstone standing. 
An inconceivable testimony of human ill-will. 
The greatest deed ever in a world never to rise again.

6. The Prophetic Method
A synthesis of collective existence
A dialectic of the old order and the new world
Demise; a fall of Absolutes
Imminence; a choir of celestial flutes

Discontinuity between the two domains
Forever and always reigns
Plain logic strategy, it will be

Deconstruction, a tool for demonising

By which the population will only see a fraction

3. Chaos Deathcult
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor/ T. Akkerhaugen]

Esoteric knowledge about the last of things. 
My sweet eschatological vision. 
Foundation for the renewal of the world, 
immemorial sins, never redeemed. 
Suppressed, oppressed, never redeem again. 
The sulphur-kingdom, purgatory, hell`s damnation,

Where is your millennium?

5. Zycloned
[Musick: Zamoth/ Trym]

Stereogothic void - predestination of being. 
Psychothronic schizoid - conditioning the future. 
Past without content - life without meaning

The New World Inc. executes standardization 
   in a futuristic framework of sterility. 
Why is everything so constant? 
Why doesn`t things change? 
You`ll never be alone again.

Patterns of dominant contraception displaying. 
The New World Inc. deciding your mental agenda. 
Creations of a disillusioned mind. 
Never forsake the Providence; 
the mind-altered herald. 
Deathlike silence - cyber scenario turns the ego.

Inbred conveyer - psychedelic vultures disrupting the social order. 
Segregation, still no reason to inhale the dirt. 
No sivilization without stability, 
no individual equilibrium without emotional equality.

Stereogothic void - predestination of being. 
Psychothronic schizoid - conditioning the future.
It`s nightfall and world-wide disinfection. 
It`s a Z-kloned syndrome revealing spirituality as something absent. 
You`ll never be alone again.

7. Worm World
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

Planetary sickness, the state of the world. 
Time, Death, God; 
inbreed overkill altered through decayed moral causing global infection. 
Compulsion of matter, 
the remaining part of dreariness and obsolete dejection. 
Man breeds ignorance and fatality. 
Empty eyes and a soul forsaken, an intellect like zero, 
reasons for pandemic genocide. 
Human trash, wasted flesh, is that what you wanna be? 
Practise what you preach.

In despite of development from chaos humanity has degenerated 
in relation to the primordial state. 
Misconception and misinterpretation of values, 
surrounds you like a mental drape.

You stink - that`s how you are. 
You reek - that`s what you`re at. 
You are mentally dead - that`s what you`ve become. 
You are matter without content - that`s what you`re all about. 
And you thought you were the highlight of the ladder of evolution?

No matter if you do your best, 
it`s still a worm world with you in the middle of the viper`s nest.

4. Two Thousand Years
Two thousand years of unrealised eschatology
No hold for divine dispensation
Obey through my external service
Value my redemptive power

Feel so much gratitude,
Only levelled by relative magnitude
Chiliasm proved by doctrinal code
Millenarism to be established by utter instinctual mode

Two thousand years of morals as figure,
Taught individually by example
Never share with me your disclaims,
Picture only what you're worth
In all your incompleteness

Condemnation could only be revealed through liberation
Apocalyptic as in clear-cut context
No more words needed, final result is man
As he shall ever be; striving, acting and suffering

7. Underdog
When telling the fable of men
The Demise of lies
Let the Underdog be the narrator
Behold the kingdom's rise
Always being held down, the weaker part
You see, that's the state of the art
Father from truth, further from sight
So whoever yelled "might's right"?
A glimmer from the past
The stronger can easily fabricate
A life ending so fast
Anything impious you'll ever advocate
A glint of truth, a vision of rectitude
Whoever took that as bad attitude?
The Underdog will forever remain the unofficial hero
Pictured in a golden covered frame

6. Vile Ritual
Recite the unspoken
A manifest of the Great Self
A solid faith in what you can accomplish
A supreme vision of capability
An arcane text
Describing an outrageous test
Too bold the modern ones would say
You can always pray
A vile ritual bleeding
Like a spear of hate
Almost like the predator's feeding
Consolidating every man's fate
Oh venerable ancestors
Please grant me with my pagan fest
I'm equal to my human contester
May it be a fight for all the best
Would the few of us ever accept
A moral that is slightly trite?
A sun that never sets is still being bright
Small pieces of heathen soil can make any man's blood boil
A violation of anything supreme has come into regularity in any scene
Never condone the residue of human scald
Boiling in water that is still cold
A modern day heresy it would be in fact
Just let me have my vile ritual intact

9. Vulture
Throbbing; The vast deceiver
Underdog, god of all men
Crushing; bone and skin to the ground
Dying, but still vital
Where would it head me? Fresh, yet rotten to the core
Would you ever join me?
Howling; heresy to the end
Tribe and unit; one of a kind
Searching; but nowhere to find
Does that make sense to you?
Walk alone or all fly
One watching the other die
Simple, cold and awaiting
You'll never stop hating
Hell on earth
Was it what I wanted? A peaceful mind
Rejoice with me
Vulture - may I take your shape?
Vulture - tell me of my fate
Vulture - your kingdom come
Vulture - take me home

3. Ways Of The World
Lack of motivation? At every occasion
Tell me, did you earn your name?
So why did you reckon it would bring you fame?
Lack of understanding? It's kind of demanding
So then, did you earn your respect?
I'd rather say you suffer from a defect
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, it will at least bring humility
For all what it's worth - past glory
I bring no comfort
Lack of dedication? That's why I'm on medication
Well, how did you ever earn your integrity?
You're nothing but a failure in eternity
Lack of measures? I never found any treasures
Now, how did you get your crown?
For me it'll represent the lake in which you'll drown
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity
For now, at least it will bring humility
For all it's worth - final cut
I will keep my mouth shut

7. Worm World
[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

Planetary sickness, the state of the world. 
Time, Death, God; 
inbreed overkill altered through decayed moral causing global infection. 
Compulsion of matter, 
the remaining part of dreariness and obsolete dejection. 
Man breeds ignorance and fatality. 
Empty eyes and a soul forsaken, an intellect like zero, 
reasons for pandemic genocide. 
Human trash, wasted flesh, is that what you wanna be? 
Practise what you preach.

In despite of development from chaos humanity has degenerated 
in relation to the primordial state. 
Misconception and misinterpretation of values, 
surrounds you like a mental drape.

You stink - that`s how you are. 
You reek - that`s what you`re at. 
You are mentally dead - that`s what you`ve become. 
You are matter without content - that`s what you`re all about. 
And you thought you were the highlight of the ladder of evolution?

No matter if you do your best, 
it`s still a worm world with you in the middle of the viper`s nest.

8. Wrenched
In the yard of the old man
The ruin's shimmering
The world's painted pale
The conditions are at stale
Flocks gathered from far away
Hiding, still overly aggressive
Generations they will slay
Not really regressive
A dead end cave
Home of the brave
The world fools no one
Grace me with hammering rest
Keep an eye on the sea
Imagine what we would be
Rushing to the shores
God of all damn wars
Wrenched beyond recognition
No such thing as human intuition
Feel free to turn the supreme ignition

5. Zycloned
[Musick: Zamoth/ Trym]

Stereogothic void - predestination of being. 
Psychothronic schizoid - conditioning the future. 
Past without content - life without meaning

The New World Inc. executes standardization 
   in a futuristic framework of sterility. 
Why is everything so constant? 
Why doesn`t things change? 
You`ll never be alone again.

Patterns of dominant contraception displaying. 
The New World Inc. deciding your mental agenda. 
Creations of a disillusioned mind. 
Never forsake the Providence; 
the mind-altered herald. 
Deathlike silence - cyber scenario turns the ego.

Inbred conveyer - psychedelic vultures disrupting the social order. 
Segregation, still no reason to inhale the dirt. 
No sivilization without stability, 
no individual equilibrium without emotional equality.

Stereogothic void - predestination of being. 
Psychothronic schizoid - conditioning the future.
It`s nightfall and world-wide disinfection. 
It`s a Z-kloned syndrome revealing spirituality as something absent. 
You`ll never be alone again.
